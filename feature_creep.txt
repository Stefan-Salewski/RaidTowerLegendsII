MENU
Menu features:
* 'start new run'
'store' in roguelike games usually there's currency for permanent upgrades.
But idk if we doin this, cause then we'd have to add save data

'settings' , we'll add this button right away but initially it'll just be a coming soon page.


SETTINGS
In the case we make settings later, things to add:
Option to set fps (this'll change the fps variable)
sound on/off (this is assuming we add sound effects for attacking enemies or something)
music on/off (this is assuming we add music to the game)
toggle fps counter
make an antialiasing toggle

PAUSE BUTTON
During game play, ability to toggle settings and quit game or restart with new run
