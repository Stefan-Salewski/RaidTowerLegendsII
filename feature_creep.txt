MENU
Menu features:
* 'start new run'
'store' in roguelike games usually there's currency for permanent upgrades.
But idk if we doin this, cause then we'd have to add save data

'settings' , we'll add this button right away but initially it'll just be a coming soon page.


SETTINGS
In the case we make settings later, things to add:
Option to set fps (this'll change the fps variable)
sound on/off (this is assuming we add sound effects for attacking enemies or something)
music on/off (this is assuming we add music to the game)
toggle fps counter
make an antialiasing toggle

POWERUPS
speed boost
gigantification (health+, size+,bigger bullets, dmg+)
invincibility star --> invulnerable state for a period of time, really just whatever is easiest to code
