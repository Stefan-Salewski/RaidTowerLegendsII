MENU
Menu features:
* 'start new run'
'store' in roguelike games usually there's currency for permanent upgrades.
But idk if we doin this, cause then we'd have to add save data

'settings' , we'll add this button right away but initially it'll just be a coming soon page.


SETTINGS
In the case we make settings later, things to add:
Choice between wasd and arrow keys for movement
Option to set fps (this'll change the fps variable)
sound on/off (this is assuming we add sound effects for attacking enemies or something)
music on/off (this is assuming we add music to the game)
